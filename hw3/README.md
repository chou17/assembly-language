Write an ARM assembly program to do the matrix computation.
  A is a 2x4 matrix and B is a 4x2 matrix
  C is a 2x2 matrix
  C = A × B
  Each element in A, B, and C is a word-sized integer.
  The overflow/underflow problems are not considered during the computation. 
  After computation, register r1 will point to the address of C’s first element.
